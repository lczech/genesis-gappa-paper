# genesis-gappa-paper
Scripts and tests for the Application Note of our library [genesis](https://github.com/lczech/genesis) and our toolkit [gappa](https://github.com/lczech/gappa). These tests are used for evaluating runtime and memory of genesis for some typical tasks, in comparison to other bioinformatics libraries with similar functionality.

## Test Cases

Sequence Test Cases:

 - `read_fasta`: Read large files in fasta format
 - `read_phylip`: Read large files in phylip format
 - `base_frequencies`: Calculate the character frequencies of a set of sequences
 
Tree Test Cases:

 - `read_newick`: Read large trees in newick format
 - `pairwise_patristic`: Calculate the pairwise patristic distance matrix between nodes in a tree

Jplace Test Cases:

 - `read_jplace`: Reading large jplace files
